# Python-Test
TaskA
- Made it so you can choose which name from the results you want, not only the 2nd place. So that there is less static
- variables. Although if I should stick to the task and make it to only show the 2nd position, then I would just put the
- value "2" instead the input() method.

TaskC
- It's only 99% complete since I couldn't find a solution to how to order it first by value of the dictionary 
- and then by the key. Spent like 2-3 hours on that.
- There are some stuff that could definitely be done better. For example the amount of most frequent numbers could be a variable. 
- Now it's showing just those three.
